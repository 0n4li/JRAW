/**
 * This class represents one comment in a comment tree.
 *
 * Each CommentNode has a depth, a [Comment] instance, and zero or more CommentNode children. Depth is defined as how
 * many parents the comment has. For example, a top-level reply has a depth of 1 (the Submission where it was posted is
 * a top-level comment's parent), a reply to that comment has a depth of 2, and so on.
 *
 * At the root of every comment tree there is a single root node, which represents the submission the comments belong
 * to. This node will have a depth of 0 and its children will be top-level replies to the submission. Although this node
 * is technically part of the tree, it will not be included when iterating the nodes with [traverser].
 *
 * For example, take this tree structure:
 *
 * ```
 *       z
 *       |
 *       a
 *     / | \
 *    b  c  d
 *       |   \
 *     f,g,h  i
 * ```
 *
 * Node `z` represents the root node (submission) with a depth of 0. Node `a` is a top level reply to that submission
 * with a depth of 1. Nodes `f`, `g` and `h`, and `i` have a depth of 3. This tree can be traversed using several
 * different methods: Pre-order (`abcfghdi`), post-order (`bfghcida`), and breadth-first (`abcdfghi`).
 *
 * Note that although this class implements Iterable, the provided Iterator will only iterate through direct
 * children. To walk the entire tree, use [walkTree].
