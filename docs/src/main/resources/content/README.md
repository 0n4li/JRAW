> The Java Reddit API Wrapper

JRAW was designed to be *the* reddit API wrapper for the JVM. It offers a simplistic yet powerful API and handles OAuth2 with ease. JRAW is actually written in Kotlin, but keeps "Java" in the name for historical reasons.

If you're new to JRAW, you'll probably want to start off with the [quickstart](quickstart.md) or [basics](basics.md) page.

If you have any questions or find a bug, don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/mattbdean/JRAW/issues/new).
